# Visualizing the gender gap across college degrees
In this project, we are going to show the gender gap across college degrees by using Visualization tools.

The Department of Education Statistics releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category. Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website. You can download the dataset Randal compiled here.

### Summary of results
After analysing the data, It appears that the gender gap is narrowing in subjects like Engineering, Physical Sciences, Agriculture, Business and Architecture from 1970 to 2010. At same time the gender gap is increading in Psychology, Public Administration. Others remain similar.
